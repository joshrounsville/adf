        <p>Players are the most important people in the sport. Playing for the team, and for the team to win, is the most fundamental part of the game. But not winning-at-all costs! Fair play and respect for all others in the game is fundamentally important.</p>

        <p class="strong pad-b--10">ADF Players must abide by these simple rules.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pad-b--2x">

          <li>Attend scheduled training, practices, and games on time and appropriately equipped.</li>
          <li>Understand that failure to meet agreed upon expectations for practices and training can negatively influence playing time.</li>
