        <p>ADF's academy training facility is housed within the Mittleman Jewish Community Centerâ€™s Sportsplex aka "The Bubble." The Bubble's indoor field is ideal for year round training because it is heated in winter and air conditioned in summer. Smaller group academy sessions are also held on The Bubble's smaller secondary training field. Spectators appreciate the ample seating and excellent visibility that this facility provides.</p>
